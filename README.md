Project Overview:-
Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict the price of homes based on certain key features, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and age of the home. This project uses linear regression, a statistical technique, to model the relationship between the home features and their prices.

Why Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a simple and interpretable machine learning model used to predict a continuous target variable (in this case, home price) based on one or more predictor variables (features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.). It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which works well for predicting numeric values like price.

Handling Missing Data:
Before applying any machine learning algorithms, it's important to check for missing values in the dataset. Missing data can distort the model's performance. Common strategies include:

Imputation: Filling missing values with the mean or median (for numerical data).
Deletion: Removing rows or columns that contain too many missing values.

Key Features of the Dataset:-

In this project, the dataset consists of information about homes and their corresponding prices. The primary goal is to predict home prices using features (independent variables) such as:

Square Footage: The total area of the home, typically in square feet. Larger homes usually have higher prices.
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house. Homes with more bedrooms are often priced higher.
Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house. Like bedrooms, more bathrooms generally increase the price.
Age of the Home: The age of the property in years. Older homes may be priced lower due to wear and tear, unless they have historical value.
Location: In some cases, the location or neighborhood is an important feature that affects price (though it may need special encoding techniques if it is categorical).
The target variable is the Price of the home, which is the value we aim to predict.

 Model Building: Linear Regression make fit and predict the data.
